# Risk5

## Description
Risk5 is a online multiplayer game based on the famous boardgame "Risk". It was developed as part of "Praktikum Siftware Engineering" in the University of Mannhaim. The game follow the rulebook as outlined by the board game. There are tutorial, singleplayer and online multiplayer optios. Players ca play against humans and/or AI players.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Coming soon...

## Roadmap
Many features can be implemented. For example, but not limited to: visuals to signify player interaction (highlight territory on click, show which can be selected, arrows), robust server communication (implement a handshake protocol for transimtting messages), different game modes (risk outlines several ways to play the original game, currently only the basic game mode is avaiable)
